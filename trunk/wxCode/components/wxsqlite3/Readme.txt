wxSQLite3 component info
------------------------

Website:      http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/components/wxsqlite3
Version:      3.0.4
Description:
wxSQLite3 is a C++ wrapper around the public domain SQLite 3.x database
and is specifically designed for use in programs based on the wxWidgets
library.

wxSQLite3 does not try to hide the underlying database, in contrary
almost all special features of the current SQLite3 version 3.7.16 are
supported, like for example the creation of user defined scalar or
aggregate functions.

Since SQLite stores strings in UTF-8 encoding, the wxSQLite3 methods
provide automatic conversion between wxStrings and UTF-8 strings. This
works best for the Unicode builds of wxWidgets. In ANSI builds the
current locale conversion object (wxConvCurrent) is used for conversion
to/from UTF-8. Special care has to be taken if external administration
tools are used to modify the database contents, since not all of these
tools operate in Unicode or UTF-8 mode.

         wxWidgets 2.9.x. To compile and link wxSQLite+ successfully
         using wxWidgets 2.8.x it is required to build the "stc" library
         (scintilla) in the "contrib" folder of wxWidgets.
         Please note that wxSQLite+ is under GPL license.

Installation
------------

a) wxMSW

When building on win32, you can use the makefiles in the BUILD folder.

SQLite version 3.8.0 DLL is included. The included link library was
built with MS Visual C++ 6. For other compilers it can be necessary to
regenerate the link library based on the sqlite.def file in the LIB
folder.

mingw: dlltool -d sqlite3.def -D sqlite3.dll -l sqlite3.a

(As demanded by several users sqlite3.a for mingw is now included.)

The directory sqlite3/lib contains the original DLL from the SQLite
distribution.

In prior versions of wxSQLite3 the directory sqlite3/meta contained
a special DLL version including support for the optional SQLite meta
data methods. Since meta data support is now enabled in the SQLite binary
distribution as a default, the DLL has been dropped from the wxSQLite3
distribution.

To get the sample application to work the SQLite DLL to be used has to
be copied to the samples directory.

If you want to use the optional SQLite meta data methods SQLite needs
to be compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA (as is the case for
the DLL version in directory sqlite3/meta). Additionally the
preprocessor symbol WXSQLITE3_HAVE_METADATA must be defined when
compiling wxSQLite3.

All included SQLite DLLs have the FTS3 module enabled.

On user request a precompiled SQLite shell program supporting encrypted
databases is included. Use

PRAGMA KEY="encryption key";

to create or open an encrypted database. Use

ATTACH DATABASE x AS y KEY z;

to attach an encryted database.

b) wxGTK

When building on an autoconf-based system (like Linux/GNU-based
systems), you can use the existing configure script in the component's
ROOT folder or you can recreate the configure script doing:

  cd build
  ./acregen.sh
  cd ..

  ./configure [here you should use the same flags you used to configure wxWidgets]
  make
 
Type "./configure --help" for more info.

Note: Recreating the configure script requires the following prerequisites:
- automake 1.9.6 or higher
- bakefile 0.2.5
- wxCode autoconf and bakefile files (to be downloaded from CVS or SVN)

The autoconf-based systems also support a "make install" target which
builds the library and then copies the headers of the component to
/usr/local/include and the lib to /usr/local/lib.

SQLite version 3.8.0 is NOT included. You have to download the current
version of SQLite from http://www.sqlite.org and to install it on your
system before you can install wxSQLite3.

Use the configure option --with-sqlite3-prefix to specify the path to your
SQLite3 installation.


Optional Meta Data support
--------------------------

If you want to use the optional SQLite meta data methods SQLite needs
to be compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA. Additionally the
preprocessor symbol WXSQLITE3_HAVE_METADATA must be defined when
compiling wxSQLite3.


Optional key based database encryption support
----------------------------------------------

The public release of SQLite contains hooks for key based database
encryption, but the code for implementing this feature is not freely
available. D. Richard Hipp offers a commercial solution
(see http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/prosupport.html#crypto).

If you want to use the optional SQLite key based database encryption
you need to have the implementation of this feature and you have to
compile SQLite with the option SQLITE_HAS_CODEC. 

Additionally the preprocessor symbol WXSQLITE3_HAVE_CODEC must be
defined when compiling wxSQLite3.

There exist other commercial solutions, among them:

http://www.sqlcrypt.com
http://www.sqlite-crypt.com

Both use a slightly different encryption API, which is currently NOT
supported by wxSQLite3.

For Windows based systems there exists an open source solution:
System.Data.SQLite (see http://sqlite.phxsoftware.com). Encrypted
database files can be shared across Windows platforms only.

The author of wxSQLite3 has created a key based AES database encryption
implementation for SQLite such that sharing encrypted database files
across different platforms is supported. The implementation is based on
knowledge gained from implementing encryption support for the wxCode
component wxPdfDocument and from inspecting the source code of
System.Data.SQLite. The code implementing this feature is available in
directory sqlite3/secure/src. You may use this code on your own risk.
The subdirectory codec-c contains the necessary source files; the
SQLite amalgamation source code is included. Optionally SQLite can be
compiled including the extension function module created by Liam Healy.

Starting with the release of wxSQLite3 1.9.6 the encryption extension has
been converted from C++ to pure C and is now compatible with the SQLite
amalgamation source distribution. Just compile the file sqlite3secure.c
which includes all required source files. (The C++ version is still
included in directory codec, but it is deprecated and it's use is not
recommended anymore.)

Starting with the release of wxSQLite3 1.9.8 the encryption extension
includes an experimental implementation of 256 bit AES encryption. The
code comes without any warranty, use it at your own risk.
Currently the decision whether to use 128 bit or 256 bit AES encryption
has to be made at compile time. To enable 256 bit AES encryption define
CODEC_TYPE=CODEC_TYPE_AES256 (Default: CODEC_TYPE=CODEC_TYPE_AES128).

Don't forget to specify the preprocessor symbols from the following list
corresponding to your needs to get a valid SQLite library.

The following 2 symbols enable encryption support:

SQLITE_HAS_CODEC
CODEC_TYPE=CODEC_TYPE_AES128

In the latter symbol you may specify CODEC_TYPE_AES256 instead of
CODEC_TYPE_AES128 to enable the (experimental) support for AES 256 bit
encryption.

The following 2 symbols are usually always required resp. recommended:

SQLITE_CORE
THREADSAFE=1

The following 3 symbols are optional to enable specific SQLite features:

SQLITE_SECURE_DELETE
SQLITE_SOUNDEX
SQLITE_ENABLE_COLUMN_METADATA

The following 3 symbols enable optional extension modules:

SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3
SQLITE_ENABLE_FTS3_PARENTHESIS
SQLITE_ENABLE_RTREE

For wxMSW the directory sqlite3/secure/aes128 resp. sqlite3/secure/aes128
contains a special DLL version including support for the optional SQLite
meta data methods and the optional key based database encryption
(128 resp. 256 bit AES). The modules FTS3, RTREE and ExtensionFunctions
are included as well.


Using statically linked SQLite library on Windows
-------------------------------------------------

If you want or need to compile wxSQLite3 lib in such a way that it
does not require the sqlite3.dll at run-time, you have to build a
static sqlite3 library. No modifications to wxSQLite3 are required. 

The following steps are required:

- You have to download the complete source code for sqlite from
  http://www.sqlite.org/download.html. Look for the SQLite amalganation
  archive since it already includes all generated sources and is ready
  to compile without the need for additional tools.
- Unfortunately no makefile is included. That is, you have to create a
  makefile or project file yourself. You have to build a static library
  from the amalgamation C source files.
- Replace the file sqlite3.lib in the wxSQLite3 distribution by the
  sqlite3.lib created as stated above and compile wxSQLite3 as a static
  library.
- Don't forget to set USE_DYNAMIC_SQLITE3_LOAD=0.
